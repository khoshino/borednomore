				<p>Forgot class was cancelled and found yourself with an unexpected hour of freedom? Finding yourself bored because you don't know who else is available, or what events are going on? Feel the urge to play a pick-up game of basket ball or Super-Smash Brawl but don't know who is free or how to contact them?</p>
				<p><em>Bored No More</em> is here to help!</p>
				<p><em>Bored No More</em> is a spontaneous planning app that allows users to search for events happening right now ...give or take a few hours ;) Once a user logs in using their <em>Facebook</em> account, they are able to join events or create their own. Create a public event to invite anyone to basketball, or create a private event so that only your friends can see what you are up to.</p>
				<p>"Busy, busy, busy" is the motto of modern society. In our tightly scheduled lives, it is often difficult or impossible to engage in spontaneous activities, especially if those activities involve other people with their own packed schedules. When we only have an hour free, rather than wasting half an hour of our precious time trying to figure out who is available to play a game, we'd rather sit alone and surf the net or be bored. <em>Bored No More</em> is an app that allows currently free people to easily connect with others so they can plan spontaneous group activities.</p>
